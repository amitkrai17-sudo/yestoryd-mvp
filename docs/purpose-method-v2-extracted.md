Why Yestoryd Exists

The Core Belief
Every child deserves to fall in love with reading. Not as a skill to be drilled, but as a joy to be discovered. Yestoryd exists because millions of children in India’s tier 2 and 3 cities have the curiosity but not the access, the aspiration but not the method, the parents who care but not the tools to help.

India has 250 million children aged 4-12. In tier 2 and 3 cities, English literacy is the single biggest gateway to opportunity. Yet the available options are broken: local tutors who teach grammar by rote, EdTech apps that gamify without pedagogy, and expensive international schools that serve the top 5%.
Yestoryd occupies a Blue Ocean: no competitor in India combines AI-powered diagnostic assessment, 1:1 human coaching by certified experts, structured daily practice through a parent-child partnership, and culturally relevant content designed for Indian children.
The operating philosophy is AI Brain + Human Heart. AI handles diagnosis, personalization, data intelligence, daily nudges, and automation. Certified human coaches deliver the warmth, judgment, and relationship that no algorithm can replicate. Parents are not spectators — they are partners in the journey.

The Yestoryd Method
Yestoryd’s method rests on three pillars, executed in sequence. Each pillar serves a distinct purpose in the child’s development, and skipping any one of them produces incomplete outcomes.
Pillar 1: Interest Generation
Before a child can learn to read, they must want to read. Interest generation is not a marketing strategy — it is the first pedagogical act. Yestoryd creates desire through story workshops (Kahani Time), reading yoga, podcasts, and group classes that make stories feel like play, not work. For younger children (4-6), this phase is long and immersive. For older children (8-10), it can be compressed because their cognitive curiosity is already developed.
Pillar 2: The Science of English
Once interest is established, Yestoryd teaches the mechanics: phonics (rooted in Jolly Phonics methodology, Rucha’s 7+ years of expertise), grammar, decoding, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. This is not rote learning. It is structured skill-building through the PhonicSeeds curriculum, progressing from letter sounds through vowel teams, blends, digraphs, and word families. The sequence is personalized by rAI based on each child’s diagnostic assessment.
Pillar 3: Independent Reading
The ultimate goal is a child who reads independently, for pleasure, without being asked. This is achieved through daily practice (e-learning games, parent-led activities, reading streaks), community (group classes, peer interaction), and the gradual withdrawal of scaffolding. Yestoryd’s success metric is not enrollment — it is graduation. When a child no longer needs Yestoryd, the mission is accomplished.

The ARC Method
Assess (free AI reading assessment for lead capture + comprehensive post-enrollment diagnostic) → Remediate (personalized multi-season coached program with daily practice) → Celebrate (milestone-based progress tracking, season completion, and ultimate graduation).


Three Stakeholders, One System
Every action in Yestoryd must create a hook for three stakeholders simultaneously. If any one stakeholder disengages, the system fails. This is the hardest design constraint and the strongest competitive moat.
The Child: Dopamine & Delight
The child’s hook is always emotional. A 4-year-old needs silly sounds, repetition, and “I did it!” moments. A 10-year-old needs mastery, social validation, and cool factor. The platform must be so engaging that the child chooses to come back. For younger children, this happens through the coach and parent. For older children, this happens through gamification, streaks, leaderboards, and AI-powered challenges on the platform.
The Parent: Visible Progress & Partnership
The parent’s hook is proof. “My child did something today they couldn’t do yesterday.” In tier 2/3 homes, this also means something they can demonstrate — to the grandparent on a video call, to the neighbor, to themselves. Parents are not passive buyers. At enrollment, they take an oath: a specific, weekly commitment to participate in their child’s reading journey. The commitment is concrete (10 minutes of reading nightly, logged with a single tap), tracked (weekly checklist delivered via WhatsApp), and celebrated (anonymous leaderboard showing their consistency percentile among Yestoryd parents).
Yestoryd makes this easy. rAI generates the weekly parent tasks contextually, linked to the child’s learning plan. The parent doesn’t have to figure out what to do — they just have to do it and tap “done.”
The Coach: Empowered Focus
The coach’s hook is professional pride and simplicity. They walk into every session fully prepared, with zero cognitive overhead. rAI provides: the child’s diagnostic data, last session summary, parent activity completion this week, the specific session template for today, and AI-generated recommendations. The coach’s job is singular: be present with the child. Everything else — planning, tracking, reporting, parent communication — is handled by the system. Coaches see every data point about their assigned children but this information is surfaced as actionable briefs, not raw data.

Two-Stage Assessment Model
Yestoryd uses two distinct assessments with different purposes, timing, and depth. This separation is intentional: the free assessment has a conversion job; the post-enrollment diagnostic has a pedagogical job. Conflating them weakens both.
Stage 1: Free AI Assessment (Lead Generation)
Purpose: Get the parent through the door. Demonstrate Yestoryd’s AI capability. Capture the lead.
This stays as currently designed: a quick 5-minute audio recording analyzed by Gemini across clarity, fluency, and speed. The output is an instant certificate and report. This data is stored permanently but it is a snapshot, not a diagnosis. The free assessment must remain fast, impressive, and frictionless. The target is greater than 80% completion rate. Adding depth here would kill conversion.
Stage 2: Post-Enrollment Diagnostic (Session 1)
Purpose: Truly understand the child. Generate the personalized multi-season roadmap. Assign the right coach. Build the parent’s confidence that their investment is being taken seriously.
This happens as Session 1 of the coaching program, led by a human coach on video. The parent has already paid. They expect thoroughness. The child experiences it as a warm, engaging first meeting — not a test.

Why Human-Led, Always
The moment after payment is the highest-trust, highest-anxiety moment for the parent. A coach on screen, observing, asking questions, building rapport — that’s the moment the parent thinks “I made the right decision.” No platform quiz captures what a coach sees: how the child behaves on camera, whether they’re shy or hyperactive, whether they look at the parent for approval, whether their hesitation is about ability or confidence. These intangibles are gold for every subsequent session.

Session 1 for Foundation (Ages 4-6)
Coach-administered, parent present. 30 minutes. The child does not know they are being assessed. The entire session feels like play.
Letter recognition game (“can you find the letter that makes the sss sound?”)
Rhyme detection (“do these words rhyme? cat-bat, dog-tree”)
CVC blending attempt (“can you read this word: s-a-t?”)
Story listening + recall (read a short story, ask 3 simple questions)
Fine motor observation (pencil grip, letter tracing ability)
Coach observes: attention span, confidence, parent-child dynamic, language dominance (Hindi vs English)
Last 10 minutes: coach talks to parent alone, explains observations, previews the journey
Session 1 for Building (Ages 7-9)
Coach-administered, child-led. 45 minutes. Structured but warm — a getting-to-know-you session, not an exam.
Graded word reading (progressive difficulty from CVC to multi-syllable)
Passage reading aloud (fluency scored: speed, accuracy, expression)
Comprehension questions on the passage (literal + inferential)
Sight word recognition speed test
Simple grammar task (fill in the blank, correct the sentence)
Short writing sample (3-4 sentences on “my favorite day”)
Coach observes: decoding strategies, self-correction habits, confidence patterns
Last 10 minutes with parent: here’s what I saw, here’s what we’ll work on
Session 1 for Mastery (Ages 10-12)
Coach-led conversation + structured activities. 60 minutes. The child is old enough to be a partner in their own assessment.
Conversation: “What do you like reading? What’s hard about English for you?”
Reading comprehension passage with discussion (“I noticed you paused here — what was tricky?”)
Vocabulary in context (figure out meaning from surrounding text, not word lists)
Grammar application (identify and fix errors in text, not rules recitation)
Writing sample (a full paragraph on a prompt)
Spoken English: 2-minute free talk (Gemini analyzes fluency, hesitation, code-switching)
Last 10 minutes with parent: frank conversation about the roadmap and expectations
From Diagnostic to Plan
After Session 1, the coach submits a diagnostic session form — richer than the regular post-session form. It captures: skill-level observations across all dimensions relevant to that age band, behavioral notes (attention, confidence, parent dynamic), language dominance assessment, and the coach’s initial recommendation for learning focus areas.
rAI ingests this data overnight and generates two outputs: the multi-season journey roadmap (high-level: season names, goals, expected milestones) and the Season 1 learning plan (detailed: week-by-week session templates). The coach reviews the plan before Session 2.
The parent receives the roadmap via WhatsApp within 24 hours of Session 1. This 24-hour window is a magic moment. The parent just watched the coach engage with their child. Now they receive a personalized multi-season plan. The connection between “someone observed my child carefully” and “here’s a custom plan just for her” — that’s when Yestoryd becomes irreplaceable in the parent’s mind.

Age-Differentiated Journeys
A 4-year-old and a 10-year-old joining Yestoryd are on fundamentally different journeys. They differ in session density, session length, who leads the learning, how the parent participates, and what the daily practice looks like. The 12-week season structure is consistent, but its composition is radically different.

Foundation Band (Ages 4-6): Human-Led
These children are pre-readers or early readers. They cannot self-direct. The coach works heavily through the parent — modeling how to read aloud, play sound games, and make stories interactive. Sessions are 30 minutes because attention spans are short. Frequency is twice per week because the neural pathways for phonemic awareness require consistent, close-spaced repetition. The parent is present in every session and responsible for daily story time. Group classes (Kahani Time, Reading Yoga) are play-based and require no reading ability. Most Foundation children will need 3-4 seasons to reach independent reading.
Building Band (Ages 7-9): Hybrid
These children can follow instructions and are beginning to decode. The coach works directly with the child, with the parent as observer and practice supervisor. Sessions are 45 minutes. Frequency is 1.5x per week. Daily practice shifts toward a mix of parent-led reading and platform-based games. This is the sweet spot for phonics methodology. Most Building children will need 2-3 seasons.
Mastery Band (Ages 10-12): Platform-Led
These children can read basics but need fluency, comprehension, and confidence — especially in English as a second language. The coach is a mentor. Sessions are 60 minutes, once per week. The platform carries the daily load: AI-powered challenges, reading streaks, creative writing prompts, vocabulary games. Group classes (Creative Writing, Grammar Challenge) are peer-driven. Most Mastery children will need 1-2 seasons.

The Multi-Season Journey Roadmap
Every child’s complete reading journey is made visible at enrollment. The parent sees the full road — 3 to 6 seasons — with clear milestones at each stage. They commit to Season 1 and continue when they see progress. Long journey, clear milestones.
How It Works
After Session 1 (diagnostic), rAI generates the full multi-season roadmap based on the child’s assessment profile and age band
The roadmap shows: season names, goals, estimated session counts, and expected milestone outcomes for each season
Only the current season’s detailed week-by-week plan is generated (because the child’s progress will change what comes next)
The roadmap is shared with the parent via WhatsApp within 24 hours of Session 1, and displayed on the parent dashboard
At the end of each season, exit assessment updates the roadmap for the next season
Example: Foundation Child (Age 5)
Based on Riya’s diagnostic session, here is her reading journey:

Season
Focus
Milestone
Season 1 (Wk 1-12)
Story Love — phonemic awareness, letter sounds
Riya recognizes all letter sounds and reads 10 CVC words
Season 2 (Wk 13-24)
Reading Power — blends, sight words, early fluency
Riya reads simple sentences independently
Season 3 (Wk 25-36)
Free Flight — fluency, comprehension, confidence
Riya reads age-appropriate books on her own
Graduation
Independent reader
Riya no longer needs Yestoryd

Example: Mastery Child (Age 10)
Based on Arjun’s diagnostic session, here is his reading journey:

Season
Focus
Milestone
Season 1 (Wk 1-12)
Comprehension & Confidence — inference, context, expression
Arjun reads and understands grade-level texts with nuance
Season 2 (Wk 13-24)
Expression & Independence — creative writing, advanced vocabulary
Arjun writes creatively and reads advanced texts independently
Graduation
Independent reader and writer
Arjun no longer needs Yestoryd


The Commitment Psychology
The parent isn’t signing up for 9 months. They’re enrolling in Season 1. But they can see the full road. They understand where Season 1 sits in the larger arc. When Season 1 ends and they’ve seen progress, continuing to Season 2 feels like the natural next step — not a new buying decision. The roadmap makes inaction feel like a conscious choice to stop the child’s progress. Long journey, clear milestones, one season at a time.

Milestone Design: Shareable Progress
Each season ends with a tangible, shareable milestone — not just a certificate, but a demonstrated capability:
A short video of the child reading something they couldn’t read 12 weeks ago (recorded in the final session)
A progress comparison: entry assessment vs exit assessment, visualized simply
A graduation certificate for the season, designed to be shared on WhatsApp
In tier 2/3 India, progress that can be demonstrated socially drives re-enrollment more than any discount

The Daily Experience
The 12-week season is not 12/18/24 sessions. It is 84 consecutive days of reading engagement, with coaching sessions as periodic high-points. The daily experience builds the habit. The coaching sessions build the skill. Both are essential.
The Daily Nudge
Every morning, rAI delivers a contextual task to the parent (for younger children) or the child (for older children) via WhatsApp. The task is linked to the child’s learning plan: if the last coaching session introduced L-blends, the daily tasks that week reinforce L-blends through home activities. Each task is designed to be completed in under 10 minutes and logged with a single tap.
The Parent Oath & Checklist
At enrollment, the parent takes a concrete oath: a specific weekly commitment appropriate to their child’s age band. For a Foundation parent: “I will do 10 minutes of story time every night and log it.” For a Mastery parent: “I will ensure 20 minutes of daily platform access.”
The weekly checklist contains 5-7 tasks mixing home reading activities, group class attendance, platform game time, and coaching session participation. Delivered every Monday via WhatsApp as a clickable checklist. Parents who maintain streaks receive anonymous recognition: “You’re in the top 20% of Yestoryd parents this week!”
Group Classes (4 per week)
Four sessions per week, each targeting a different age band and skill: Kahani Time and Reading Yoga for younger children, Creative Writing and Grammar Challenge for older children. Enrolled families attend free. Non-enrolled families pay ₹199-400, creating a low-friction acquisition funnel. Instructors are invited reference experts or Yestoryd coaches, managed by Rucha on revenue-share or fixed-cost basis. Coaches can run their own group classes as an additional revenue stream.
Platform Engagement
The e-learning platform provides self-paced practice through 5 game engines (Word Match, Phonics Pop, Sentence Builder, Story Sequence, Rhyme Time), powered by spaced repetition (SM-2 algorithm). Focus Mode presents one Mission Card at a time. Gamification includes XP, badges, streaks, and a celebration ladder. Content is personalized by rAI. E-learning content is currently in active development.

The Intelligence Layer: rAI
rAI (Reading AI) is Yestoryd’s intelligence engine. It is not a chatbot. It is a pedagogical reasoning system that powers every personalized experience.
What rAI Does
Powers the free AI assessment (lead generation) and supports the post-enrollment diagnostic (data capture)
Generates personalized multi-season roadmaps from diagnostic data + age band
Creates detailed season learning plans by selecting and sequencing session templates
Generates contextual weekly parent task checklists linked to the learning plan
Prepares coach pre-session briefs with full child context and session templates
Analyzes coaching session transcripts and merges with coach observations
Sends daily WhatsApp nudges to parents and children
Generates re-enrollment recommendations with next-season learning plans
Supports coach-in-the-loop plan adaptation when coach requests a revision
Personalizes e-learning content selection and difficulty progression
What rAI Must See (Single Source of Truth)
rAI’s effectiveness depends on data completeness. All data sources must be vectorized into the learning_events pipeline. Currently only 30% of available data is vectorized. The following must be added as immediate technical debt:
Coach post-session observations (36 data points per session)
Session 1 diagnostic form data (richer assessment observations)
Parent daily activity logs (checklist completion, reading time)
E-learning game engagement data (scores, time, completion, struggles)
Group class attendance and participation
Assessment history (free assessment, diagnostic, mid-point, exit)

Architecture Principle
Everything is powered by rAI. Everything is linked to the database as a single source of truth. rAI must see every interaction to respond and recommend effectively. Partial data produces partial intelligence — and partial intelligence is worse than no intelligence, because it creates false confidence.


Personalized Learning Plans
No two children within the same age band follow the same learning flow. External variables (session length, session count, program duration) are consistent. Internal variables (skill sequence, pace, content difficulty) are personalized.
The Session Template Library
Rucha curates a library of session templates — each targeting a specific skill at a specific level. Templates are tagged by: skill dimension, difficulty level, age suitability, prerequisites, session duration, and required materials. Examples:
“CVC Word Building — Level 2”: targets phonics/decoding, difficulty 4/10, 30 min, parent-assisted
“Story Retelling with Prompts”: targets comprehension + fluency, difficulty 6/10, 45 min, child-led
“Blend Safari — L-blends”: targets phonics, difficulty 5/10, uses PhonicSeeds content, 30 min
Rucha is the pedagogical authority: she curates, reviews, and approves every template. rAI is the routing engine: it selects, sequences, and adapts. AI Brain + Human Heart.
Plan Generation Flow
Session 1 diagnostic data is submitted by the coach
rAI identifies skill gaps relative to age-appropriate benchmarks
rAI selects and sequences session templates from Rucha’s library
Plan respects prerequisite chains (letter sounds before blends, blends before digraphs)
Plan is displayed to the coach with prep materials for each session
After each session, coach submits post-session form; if adaptation is needed, coach requests a plan update
rAI revises remaining sessions based on accumulated data (coach-in-the-loop, not auto-override)

Re-enrollment & Graduation
End of Season
Exit assessment: same dimensions as the diagnostic, scored and compared to Session 1 baseline
rAI generates a “Next Season Learning Plan”: personalized roadmap of what’s next, updated milestones
Shareable milestone: video of the child reading, before/after comparison, season certificate
Re-enrollment offer with continuity discount
If parent doesn’t re-enroll: group class access pauses, FOMO nudge activates (“Riya’s friends are in Kahani Time today!”)

The Re-enrollment Shift
The parent isn’t deciding “should I re-enroll?” They’re deciding “should I ignore this specific plan for my child’s next growth area?” Progress is the trigger for continuation, not a contract. But the full roadmap makes inaction feel like a conscious choice to halt the child’s journey.

True Graduation
When a child completes all seasons and the exit assessment shows independent reading fluency, Yestoryd celebrates loudly. A graduation ceremony, a certificate, and an invitation to become a “Reading Buddy” for younger children. Yestoryd’s ultimate success is a child who no longer needs Yestoryd. That is the most powerful testimonial imaginable.

Pricing

Pricing Under Revision
The proposition described in this document — comprehensive diagnostic, personalized multi-season roadmap, variable session density by age, daily rAI-powered nudges, group classes, and parent partnership system — represents significantly more value than the current ₹5,999 for 6 sessions. Pricing will be restructured upward to reflect this enhanced offering. The new pricing model will account for per-session coach costs that vary by age band (shorter sessions for younger, longer for older), platform and AI-powered features, group class access for enrolled families, and the multi-season journey commitment. Specific pricing tiers and structures will be finalized based on cost modeling and market testing.
